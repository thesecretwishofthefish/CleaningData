##Source Dataset

The original data set can be found here [Dataset.zp](https://d396qusza40orc.cloudfront.net/getdata%2Fprojectfiles%2FUCI%20HAR%20Dataset.zip)

The experiments involved 30 volunteers with an age between 19 and 38 years performing six different activities (WALKING, WALKING_UPSTAIRS, WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS, SITTING, STANDING, LAYING) 
while wearing a smartphone (Samsung Galaxy S II) on the waist. Signal coming from the device sensors (accelerometer and gyroscope) were pre-processed by applying various signal processing techniques.

'-XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

	-mean(): Mean value
	-std(): Standard deviation
	-mad(): Median absolute deviation 
	-max(): Largest value in array
	-min(): Smallest value in array
	-sma(): Signal magnitude area
	-energy(): Energy measure. Sum of the squares divided by the number of values. 
	-iqr(): Interquartile range 
	-entropy(): Signal entropy
	-arCoeff(): Autorregresion coefficients with Burg order equal to 4
	-correlation(): correlation coefficient between two signals
	-maxInds(): index of the frequency component with largest magnitude
	-meanFreq(): Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
	-skewness(): skewness of the frequency domain signal 
	-kurtosis(): kurtosis of the frequency domain signal 
	-bandsEnergy(): Energy of a frequency interval within the 64 bins of the FFT of each window.
	-angle(): Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle() variable:

	-gravityMean
	-tBodyAccMean
	-tBodyAccJerkMean
	-tBodyGyroMean
	-tBodyGyroJerkMean
